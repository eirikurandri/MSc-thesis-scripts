# MSc-thesis-scripts
This repository contains the scripts relevant to the my thesis. 
They are split into two sections. 
The first section is Pre-processing, which is the bioinformatic preprocessing of sequences from the demultiplexed sequences to the curated ASV table. 
The second section is the final analyses performed in R on the curated ASV table and includes the quality control and the analysis of the faeces samples.
