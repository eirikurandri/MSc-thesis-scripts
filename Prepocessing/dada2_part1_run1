# Description for filtering, using DADA2
#INPUT: forward_reads, reverse_reads
#OUTPUT: filtered_forward_reads, filtered_reverse_reads:
# maxEE=Maximum amount of estimated errors that you expect to see and read
#rm.phix: removes any reads that match the PhiX bacteriophage genome, which is typically added to Illumina sequencing runs for quality monitoring
#truncLen: parameter setting the minimum size to trim the forward and reverse reads to in order to keep the quality scores roughly above 30 overall
#minLen: is setting the minimum length reads we want to keep after trimming
#no minLen value in dada2 tutorial
#maxN: additional filtering default parameter that is removing any sequences containing any Ns
#truncq= truncates your reads at the first base pair with a quality score equal to or less than 2
#compress=TRUE: FASTQ files gzipped
#multithread=TRUE: FASTQ files process in parallel

#Filtering

#The developers have incorporated a plotting function to visualize how well the estimated error rates match up with the observed:
#The red line is what is expected based on the quality score, the black line represents the estimate, and the black dots represent the observed.
#In generally speaking, you want the observed (black dots) to track well with the estimated (black line)
#In geneal, error rate decreases as Q scores increases

#Dereplication:keep/process one, and just attach the identical sequences to it
#When DADA2 dereplicates sequences, it also generates a new quality-score profile of each unique sequence
#based on the average quality scores of each base of all of the sequences that were replicates of it.
#the sample names in these objects are initially the file names of the samples, this sets them to the sample names for the rest of the workflow

#It does this by incorporating the consensus quality profiles and abundances of each unique sequence, and then figuring out if each sequence more likely to be of biological origin or more likely to be spurious.
